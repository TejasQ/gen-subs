## Features

- 🔒 **Secure and offline** - All machine learning models are downloaded and run locally on your device. No data is sent to any server. There is zero dependency on OpenAI or other cloud services.
- 🌐 **Multilingual** - Supports a wide variety of languages. Namely,
  | Languages | | |
  | --------- | --------- | --------- |
  | 🇺🇸 English | 🇮🇳 Indian English | 🇨🇳 Chinese |
  | 🇷🇺 Russian | 🇫🇷 French | 🇩🇪 German |
  | 🇪🇸 Spanish | 🇵🇹 Portuguese/Brazilian | 🇬🇷 Greek |
  | 🇹🇷 Turkish | 🇻🇳 Vietnamese | 🇮🇹 Italian |
  | 🇳🇱 Dutch | 🇪🇸 Catalan | 🇸🇦 Arabic |
  | 🇮🇷 Farsi | 🇵🇭 Filipino | 🇺🇦 Ukrainian |
  | 🇰🇿 Kazakh | 🇸🇪 Swedish | 🇯🇵 Japanese |
  | 🇪🇸 Esperanto | 🇮🇳 Hindi | 🇨🇿 Czech |
  | 🇵🇱 Polish | 🇺🇿 Uzbek | 🇰🇷 Korean |
  | 🇫🇷 Breton | | |
- 🎨 **Customizable** - Choose from getting just an `srt` file, having the subtitles burned in to your video, and even embedding the subtitles in your video's metadata. You can also have **focus words** where the active word is highlighted in a different color.
- 🎧 **Multi-modal** - Supports both audio and video files and generates subtitles for each.
- 📊 **Multi-model** - Choose from a variety of machine learning models ranging from 40MB to >2GB in size. The larger the model, the more accurate the subtitles, but smaller models are also quite capable.

## Usage

You can generate subtitles for any video using the following command:

```bash
npx gen-subs for ./your/video.mp4
```

If you run this for the first time, you will be required to download a machine learning model to generate your subtitles. This needs to be done at least one time. Then, the program will generate a `.srt` file in your current working directory containing the subtitles for your video.

### Inaccuracies

Please note that you may get inaccurate results with the default, basic English model. This model is 40MB and is meant to be a quick way to get started. It's not very smart, so your mileage may vary. If you'd like more accurate results, you can download a larger model by running the following command:

```bash
npx gen-subs models
```

This will have you choose a language and then show you a collection of models, their sizes, and intended use cases (like podcasting, content, etc.). You can then choose a model and download it. Once downloaded, you can use it to generate subtitles for your video. You only download models once, and can remove them any time by running `npx gen-subs models purge`. You can also list all your downloaded models by running `npx gen-subs models ls`.

### Other Languages

You can install a wide variety of models that can "hear" different languages. To generate subs for any language, follow these steps:

1. First, install a model with `npx gen-subs models`. You will be asked to choose a language here.
2. Then, run `npx gen-subs for ./your/video.mp4` to generate subtitles for your video, You will be asked which model to use.
3. Enjoy!

## API

This project has a few options that you can use to customize your subtitles. Let's enumerate them here. Each command comes after `npx gen-subs` and is followed by a list of options.
