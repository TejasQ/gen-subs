## Features

- üîí **Secure and offline** - All machine learning models are downloaded and run locally on your device. No data is sent to any server. There is zero dependency on OpenAI or other cloud services.
- üåê **Multilingual** - Supports a wide variety of languages. Namely,
  | Languages | | |
  | --------- | --------- | --------- |
  | üá∫üá∏ English | üáÆüá≥ Indian English | üá®üá≥ Chinese |
  | üá∑üá∫ Russian | üá´üá∑ French | üá©üá™ German |
  | üá™üá∏ Spanish | üáµüáπ Portuguese/Brazilian | üá¨üá∑ Greek |
  | üáπüá∑ Turkish | üáªüá≥ Vietnamese | üáÆüáπ Italian |
  | üá≥üá± Dutch | üá™üá∏ Catalan | üá∏üá¶ Arabic |
  | üáÆüá∑ Farsi | üáµüá≠ Filipino | üá∫üá¶ Ukrainian |
  | üá∞üáø Kazakh | üá∏üá™ Swedish | üáØüáµ Japanese |
  | üá™üá∏ Esperanto | üáÆüá≥ Hindi | üá®üáø Czech |
  | üáµüá± Polish | üá∫üáø Uzbek | üá∞üá∑ Korean |
  | üá´üá∑ Breton | | |
- üé® **Customizable** - Choose from getting just an `srt` file, having the subtitles burned in to your video, and even embedding the subtitles in your video's metadata. You can also have **focus words** where the active word is highlighted in a different color.
- üéß **Multi-modal** - Supports both audio and video files and generates subtitles for each.
- üìä **Multi-model** - Choose from a variety of machine learning models ranging from 40MB to >2GB in size. The larger the model, the more accurate the subtitles, but smaller models are also quite capable.

## Installation

To install gen-subs globally, run the following command :

```bash
npm i -g gen-subs
```

It's also possible to install it on a per project basis by omitting the -g flag.

## Usage

You can generate subtitles for any video using the following command:

```bash
npx gen-subs for ./your/video.mp4
```

If you run this for the first time, you will be required to download a machine learning model to generate your subtitles. This needs to be done at least one time. Then, the program will generate a `.srt` file in your current working directory containing the subtitles for your video.

### Inaccuracies

Please note that you may get inaccurate results with the default, basic English model. This model is 40MB and is meant to be a quick way to get started. It's not very smart, so your mileage may vary. If you'd like more accurate results, you can download a larger model by running the following command:

```bash
npx gen-subs models
```

This will have you choose a language and then show you a collection of models, their sizes, and intended use cases (like podcasting, content, etc.). You can then choose a model and download it. Once downloaded, you can use it to generate subtitles for your video. You only download models once, and can remove them any time by running `npx gen-subs models purge`. You can also list all your downloaded models by running `npx gen-subs models ls`.

### Other Languages

You can install a wide variety of models that can "hear" different languages. To generate subs for any language, follow these steps:

1. First, install a model with `npx gen-subs models`. You will be asked to choose a language here.
2. Then, run `npx gen-subs for ./your/video.mp4` to generate subtitles for your video, You will be asked which model to use.
3. Enjoy!

## API

This project has a few options that you can use to customize your subtitles. Let's enumerate them here. Each command comes after `npx gen-subs` and is followed by a list of options.
